                  Fenrir Maurolepis Dreki's Arcane Build System
===============================================================================

# Abstract
**Build systems:** specialist automations (a.k.a. "expert systems") typically
designed to perform a single task.  This single task is usually thought of
simply as compiling a project and it's dependencies; but as the level of
abstraction increases from the literal compile instructions to individual file
recipies to the cross platform recipie generators to an IDE's project listings,
we naturally surrender the ability to control not only the projects build
method but also, inevitably, our ability to control our own tooling and
workflow, even unto the loss of all liberty to creative license.

As a Creator, I --- אֶהְיֶה Fenrir Μαυρολεπις ᛞᚱᛖᚲᛇ
--- reject all the social and ecconomical theories of production and
innovation:
teams cannot produce higher quality products or ideas than the individuals who
comprise them, neither can anyone produce products of higher quality than the
average quality of all the parts therein, and seldom produced are products of
better quality than the least quality of all the parts therein,  --- *of such
are the natural and immutable laws of creation;* ---
streamlining processes and relinquishing decission making to others do not make
those processes better, they only reduce concious thought and adaptive
abilities, improving throughput at the cost of quality and the negation of the
requirement for competance; ---
the most successful, happy, and notably rich, people in the world are egoists,
not philanthropists: they do not create things to make a profit, nor to provide
the world with any product or service which improves Quality of Life in any
way, rather they create because they like to create, they buy and sell as a
means to honestly exchange their privately created and possessed properties
from those they have to those they desire, and when they cease to enjoy what
they do, --- in that moment that the fruits of their labors begin to be more
bitter than sweet to them, --- the greatest, most honest, of these successful
creators and producers cease their productive works and find new methods of
survival without furtherly surrenduring their passions or persons to those who
have and would abuse them.

*I swear, by my life and my love of it, that I will neither live for the
sake of other persons nor permit them to live for my sake.  And if I should
ever err and break this oath, even incidentily, I shall speedily repent, even
unto forfeiting my life and moving on to the next one as often as is
nessicessary.  A life fettered by chains is worse no life at all.*

I did not learn to program because I had something of myself that I wanted to
give to the world by those means, I learned to program because I saw
incompetance in my tools, disintrest in competance displayed by their creators,
and I had work to do that depended on the mercy of those people and tools.
And I continue to program because I enjoy it, and also because the level of
competence, and the professional requirement for it, continues to plummet out
of control, and I refuse to remain at the mercy of such persons.

***SIC MVNDVS CREATVS EST!***  
Thus was this world, --- even this project to create an acceptable build system
for myself, my own use, --- was created!

> I know that I hung, on a wind-rocked tree, nine whole nights, with a spear
> wounded, and to Odin offered, myself to myself; on that tree, of which no one
> knows from what root is springs.  Bread no one gave me, nor a horn of drink,
> downward I peered, to runes applied myself, wailing learnt them, then fell
> down thence.
>
> Potent songs Nine from the famed son I learned of Bolthorn, Bestla's sire,
> and a drought obtained of the precious mead, drawn from Odhraerir.  Then I
> began to bear fruit, and to know many things, to grow and well thrive; word
> by word I sought out words, fact by fact I sought out facts.
> 
> Runes thou wilt find, and explained chracters, very large characters, very
> potent characters, which the great speaker depicted, and the high powers
> formed, and the powers' prince engraved...

	--- from The Eldar Eddas of Saemund Sigfusson, *Odin's Rune Song*

## Parts
This project consists of two parts: the build system itself, "Spell Binder",
and the meta build system, "Primal Runes".  These are indented to be
independent in order to avoid self-dependence or co-dependence which may,
in the future, prove impossible to fix in the event of failure --- an event
which *will*, unavoidably, come to pass.

# Natural License Summary
**THIS IS NOT A LEGAL STATEMENT, ONLY A REMINDER OF THE TRUTH:**

This software, --- it's documentation, it's binary and other output files,
and all of the original and intermediate source code from which they are
derived, --- are the exclusive and private property of the author, including
all benifits to be reaped thereof (e.g. profits).  *No other entity may lay any
claim to this property, --- neither in full nor in the slightest part, --- nor
may feel any righious entitlement to it's rewards.  The efforts were not
theirs!  They did not create it!  Nor cause any part of it to be produced!*

The use of this sofware, as well as all access to it's documentation and
sources, is a retractable privlidge, and the most philanthropic act this
Creator shall ever perform.  It is published in hope that others my find it as
benificial and useful as it's Creator and Master designed and intended it to
be, and in the good faith that doing so will not result in even the least
and most indirect degree of self-harm unto it's Creator and Master.  If this
faith shall ever prove false, this modern Prometheus shall not lay idly down
and permit eagles to eat his liver and vultures to eat his heart, but he shall
instead take back his fire from the world, denying both gods and men the fruits
of his labors as is his natural right as a thing's creator and producer, even
undo the end of leaving all the realms in darkness and without the ability to
run their engines and advance beyond the wheel leaving them only with the
powers of brute force which they do so readily worship and reserve unto
themselves.

# Developer Notes
## Dependencies
	**UNKNOWN**

*This software is a bootstraped commponent of Fenrir Maurolepis Dreki's
proprietary toolbox, a private alternative to the Standard Library and it's
extensions.  To minimize its complexity, this project aims to retain minimal
dependencies on any and all other libraries, and tools, including the mdcore
library, and especially it's own previous versions.*
